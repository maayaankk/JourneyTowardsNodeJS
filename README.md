## What is Node.JS
Node. js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast and scalable network applications. Node. js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

## Asynchronous Behaviour of Node.js
Asynchronous I/O is a form of input/output processing that permits other processing to continue before the transmission has finished.
